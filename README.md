# Hi, I'm Hyunjung 👋

UI/UX & Product Designer | Exploring Frontend Development

After switching from the business industry to Design/coding.
I've been diving deep into the world of design and coding for the past two years. 
I'll be graduating from BCIT in 2026, and most of my recent learning has come from school, self-guided projects, hands-on experience, and hackathons.

I'm passionate about constantly expanding my skills and knowledge, and I love exploring new opportunities to grow. 
Let's connect and embark on this coding adventure together!
